# Root 3 Example

This example does not have a composer.json and is used to show that phpcs and phpcbf installed globally can be used to check and fix the .php files in the root 3 dir.

This example is used in two scenarios:
1. No phpcs or phpcbf installed globally. This shows that the extension gracefully handles disabling the sniffer or fixer by workspace.
2. phpcs and phpcbf installed globally. This shows that the extension will use the global install of phpcs and phpcbf to check and fix the .php files in the root 3 dir.
